You begin to rummage through the scattered pages on the desk. 
You come across a journal entry, written hastily and with a sense of despair

Subject 18 was our greatest hope. The serum showed unprecedented results—better than all the others before her. But in the end, she too succumbed. The final phase was too much. It always is. They never survive.

You continue flipping through more pages, where the other subjects are listed
Subject 1 — terminated after rapid deterioration
Subject 7 - metabolic collapse, subject unresponsive
Subject 21 — excessive hemorrhaging, no recovery.
The same grim fates are repeated for all the others.

But 18... That number lingers in your mind, gnawing at you. For some reason, it feels like it means something. You glance back at the journal.

It reminds you, for some reason, of your daughter. May 18th. Your mind races for a moment, and a tight knot forms in your stomach. But no—there's no way. The number's just a coincidence. It has to be.
You shake your head, refusing to entertain the thought. It's ridiculous. The connection can't be real.

Still, your gaze lingers for a moment longer than you'd like, before you push the thought aside. It's just another failed experiment. Just a number.
