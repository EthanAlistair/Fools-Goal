You walk toward the end of the dining table, approach the chair at the head of the table"

As you approach, your eyes are drawn to the shattered plate on the floor, its porcelain pieces scattered among the remains of a half-eaten meal.The rest of the table seems almost too perfect. Five plates are still neatly set, untouched, as though still waiting for people to arrive.

As you stare at the plates, a small, nagging thought crosses your mind.

You brush the idea aside, dismissing it as nothing more than a coincidence. It canâ€™t be related, can it?
