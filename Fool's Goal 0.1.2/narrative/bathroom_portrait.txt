A portrait hangs on the wall above the toilet, its presence oddly out of place in such a neglected, grim room. The woman in the painting gazes down at you with a cold, unblinking stare. Her features are sharp, her expression unreadable, as if she's seen so much darkness that nothing can faze her anymore. The brushstrokes are thick and hurried, but there's an unsettling detail in the image. An ornate knife clutched tightly in her hand.

It’s not just any knife. It’s the same ornate knife you found in the dining room, Its handle, intricate and finely crafted, seems almost too real, like it could slip from the canvas and into your hand at any moment. The woman in the painting grips it with unsettling familiarity, the blade seeming too real, as if it could break free from the canvas at any moment.
