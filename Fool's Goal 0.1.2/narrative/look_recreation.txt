The room has an undeniable intimacy to it. Armchairs surround the lounge, positioned just so, like they’ve been arranged for someone to watch, to observe. Each piece of furniture feels like it’s been designed to embrace and seduce, to pull you in, as if the room itself is offering something it knows you shouldn’t want.

The tapestry on the wall stands out. Its colors are rich and warm, yet there’s something off about it. A woman, draped in a flowing gown, her posture elegant yet unnerving. She gazes into the distance, but her expression is unreadable.
