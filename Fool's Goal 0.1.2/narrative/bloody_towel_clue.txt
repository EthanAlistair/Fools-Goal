The bathtub is empty, but the grime-streaked surface tells you it hasn’t been cleaned in ages. The clawfoot legs are dull with rust, small flakes of iron scattered on the floor beneath like dried scabs.

Draped over the edge is a single towel, half-folded, as if discarded in a hurry. Stepping closer, you notice a dark stain blooming through the fabric.

It’s still damp, but not with water. The color unmistakable. The stain seeps through the fabric. Dark, fresh. Someone bled into this and left it here.
