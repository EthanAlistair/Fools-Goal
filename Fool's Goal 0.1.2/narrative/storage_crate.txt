A wooden crate sits pushed against the wall, its surface scarred with deep gouges, as if something with clawed hands had tried to rip it open. The lid is slightly ajar, leaving just enough room to glimpse inside—a collection of half-used supplies, broken tools, and a small metal tin nestled among the clutter.

Brushing aside the debris, you pull out the tin and pry it open. Inside is a thick, tar-like adhesive, its surface still tacky despite its age. Whatever it was made for, it’s clearly meant to hold something in place for good.
