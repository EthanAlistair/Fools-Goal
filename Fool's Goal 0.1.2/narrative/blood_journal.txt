You take out the bloodied towel, its fabric still damp with blood. Holding it over the journal, you squeeze the towel tightly. Blood drips steadily onto the seal.

The droplets sink into the grooves of the journal cover, the blood soaking in as if it's being absorbed.

A sudden *click* echoes, reverberating from within the journal. The cover shudders, and with a strange, wet sound, it slowly opens by itself.

As you scan through the journal, the writing reveals disturbing fragments of the daughter’s mind:

“I should be the one who stands beside her, the one who has the power, but I’m still here, waiting. Watching. What will mother do when she no longer needs her? When I am all that’s left? Will she let me be what I deserve?”

“The baby. She was always there, always weak. She couldn’t even fight for herself. But she was… a symbol of something. Something pure, something mother wanted to keep close, something I’ll never be. I don’t know why mother wanted her. She wasn’t strong, wasn’t like us. She should have been like me, like her. But she wasn’t. And now... now I’m left to pick up the pieces. What’s left of her?”

The entries feel like a slowly unraveling thread, pulling you into a dark place, one that’s been buried for too long.

As you flip through the brittle pages of the journal, your fingers brush against something odd. A torn piece of canvas catches your attention, wedged between the pages. You carefully pull it out, revealing a fragment of a portrait.

You tuck the painting fragment into your pocket, and set the journal back down.
