As you open the closet, you are initially met with neatly folded clothes and linens. Everything seems in order at first glance. But then, the unsettling smell of old blood reaches your nose, and you can't help but wonder. Where is it coming from?

Hidden beneath a pile of discarded clothes, you spot a stack of towels, all drenched in dark, dried blood. The towels are carelessly piled, as if they were discards, with no attempt to clean or fold them. It strikes you as odd, especially given the number of towelsâ€”why so many?

As you inspect the towels more closely, they seem to have been used over and over again. The bloodstains are old but thick, and as you turn the top towel over, you notice rips and tears in the fabric. It iss almost as if someone kept bleeding constantly, using these towels to cover the wounds, only to discard them when they were no longer useful.

Could this be used for some kind of ritual? It's like someone needed to bleed regularly for some reason.
