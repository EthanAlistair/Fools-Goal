The rain is relentless. Sheets of it hammer against the windshield, turning the world outside into a shifting mass of blackened trees and twisting shadows. The road ahead is barely visible, a narrow, snaking path that carves through the woods like a wound. Each turn feels tighter, every mile dragging you deeper into the belly of something ancient, something wrong.

Your grip tightens on the wheel. Knuckles pale, stiff. The cabin of the car is suffocatingly quiet, save for the rhythmic thump-thump of the wipers and the shallow rasp of your breath.

The seat beside you is empty, but it shouldn't be.

You glance at yourself in the rearview mirror. Ethan. You are Ethan Miller

You thought you were done with this. Thought you buried it. Thought you buried her. But the phone call—the voice, the name—you can't shake it.

Rose.

You thought she was gone. But here you are, chasing ghosts through a storm that doesn’t want you to arrive.

The mansion looms ahead, dark and imposing, like it’s been waiting for you. The storm rages on, but the house remains untouched. Silent. Watching.

The gate creaks open, rusty hinges groaning as if the house itself knows you’ve come. You slow as you approach, the gravel crunching beneath the tires.

Something stirs.

The hairs on your neck stand on end. Even the rain seems to hold its breath. Something is wrong here, something... alive. You can feel it, a presence pressing against you, just out of sight.

A distant thud. Then another.

You don’t turn around.

The air thickens, pressing in like it’s alive. The hum in the distance is barely audible, but you can feel it deep in your chest.

A thud. Closer this time. But you don’t dare look.

This isn’t a place for answers.

This is a place that takes.
