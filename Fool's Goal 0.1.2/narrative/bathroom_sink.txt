The sink has seen better days. Cracks line the porcelain, and the faucet is old, rusted, but still intact. The water no longer runs here, and the sink feels oddly out of place in such a neglected room. As you look closer, you spot something faint— a small stain around the drain. It doesn’t seem to be from water, though. It almost looks like... blood?

Who tried to wash off blood here? The question lingers, but there are no answers in the sink, just a slow trickle of memory. 

The cracked mirror above you doesn’t offer any comfort either. You look into it, and for a moment, you don’t recognize yourself. There’s a weariness in your eyes, a hollow look, like the weight of everything you've seen and felt is starting to show. It's as if the reflection staring back at you isn’t quite yours, like it’s someone who’s been lost to the house and its horrors.
