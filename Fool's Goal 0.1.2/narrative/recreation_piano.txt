The piano tucked into a corner has seen better days, the keys worn from years of use. A few worn music sheets sit atop the piano, one of them folded at the corner. The dark stains along the edges give the impression that these pages have borne the weight of something more than just ink. On the topmost sheet, the title remains, still barely legible: "Lullaby for a Lost Child."

The composition is incomplete—broken at some point, as if the song itself was interrupted, left unfinished. The melody seems distant, a ghost of a tune, but it carries with it a subtle tension, a sorrowful lull that never had a chance to soothe. The piece looks as though it was meant to comfort a child, but there’s something disturbingly cold about the music, as though it was intended to do more than just lull someone to sleep.
